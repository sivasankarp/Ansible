# Install Nginx using Ansible playbook

- hosts: stagingwebservers
 gather_facts: False
 vars:
  - server_port: 8080
 tasks:
  - name: install nginx
    apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
  - name: serve nginx config
     template: src=../files/flask.conf dest=/etc/nginx/conf.d/
     notify:
     - restart nginx
 handlers:
   - name: restart nginx
     service: name=nginx state=restarted
   - name: restart flask app
     service: name=flask-demo state=restarted
...


#In the above playbook, we are fetching all hosts of stagingwebservers group for executing these tasks. The first task is to install Nginx and then configure it. We are also taking a flask server for reference. In the end, we also defined handlers so that in case the state changes it will restart Nginx. After executing the above playbook we can verify whether Nginx is installed or not.

#ps waux | grep nginx
